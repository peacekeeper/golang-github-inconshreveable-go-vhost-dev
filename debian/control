Description: HTTP/TLS hostname multiplexing library for Go
 go-vhost is a simple library that lets you implement
 virtual hosting functionality for different protocols (HTTP and TLS so
 far). go-vhost has a high-level and a low-level interface. The high-level
 interface lets you wrap existing net.Listeners with "muxer" objects. You
 can then Listen() on a muxer for a particular virtual host name of
 interest which will return to you a net.Listener for just connections
 with the virtual hostname of interest.
 .
 The lower-level go-vhost interface are just functions
 which extract the name/routing information for the given
 protocol and return an object implementing net.Conn which
 works as if no bytes had been consumed.
